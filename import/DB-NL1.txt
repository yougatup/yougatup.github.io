Is it just saying that issac neton is 3 different people in 0:27
94.188000
so in short, what is the first law of motion?
113.085000
I never heard of Descartes, before now. Someone plz tell me who he is!
113.085000
"What did Descartes do to add to the first Newton's Law of motion? I know the law is also called the law of inertia  because inertia plays to it but did Descartes add to that?"
113.085000
What is Descartes contribution to Newton's first law?

94.188000
what is the exact statement of newtons first law of motion ?
90.364000
"In the video, two other physicists were mentioned (along with Newton) what did they do or what were their contributions  to the first law of motion?"
94.188000
How would you state Newton's First Law of Motion?

What is the meaning of an 'unbalanced' force?
143.097000
What does velocity technically mean?
143.097000
what is velocity?
143.097000
"Newton,Galileo,Descartes didn't have any modern techniques to prove First law of motion so how did they proved this  statement-""Objects have tendency to maintain velocity unless acted on by unbalanced force"""
193.093000
what is acceleration , speed and velocity ?
143.097000
What is velocity?
161.706000
At around 2:50, what is an example of a balanced force?
143.097000
What does velocity mean?
161.706000
"Why does Sal use the term ""unbalanced force""? The word ""unbalanced"" is particularly confusing since I learned Newton's law as follows: objects have the tendency to remain in motion until acted on by an ""outside"" force. "
161.706000
What is the meaning of 'unbalanced force' ?

What is velocity?
161.706000
What does Sal mean by an unbalanced force?
143.097000
what is velocity
161.706000
sir, can you tell me about balanced and unbalanced force
161.706000
A small question. What do you mean by unbalanced forces?
143.097000
what is velocity?
143.097000
throughout the video you used the word velocity what is velocity?
143.097000
what is velocity?
193.093000
what is acceleration , speed and velocity ?
185.914000
"From 2:56 and 3:01 Sal says 2000 years+ people believe that Objects have tendency to stop on their own, if you want to keep it moving apply force. On 3:01 Objects have tendency to maintain velocity unless acted on by an unbalanced force. So my question is who made these two rues? Was it Newton or someone else?"
237.750000
"At 4:00 - 4:10, Sal mentioned a net force... would that be the same thing a gravity?  Or would gravity full under one of the net forces?"
237.750000
at 4:31 Sal mentions about net force , what exactly is net force ?
237.750000
please define friction
237.750000
What is friction?
237.750000
What is friction? Why does it slow things down?
237.750000
What is friction?

"At 4:00 - 4:10, Sal mentioned a net force... would that be the same thing a gravity? Or would gravity  full under one of the net forces?"
49.641000
At 1:23, Why did they believe objects had a natural tendency to stop?
73.322000
AT 1:13 how can you apply a net force on an object
73.322000
how do net forces work? I don't really understand.
49.641000
at 58,how is it that objects come to a stop because of gravity? I just don't get it!
49.641000
why does objects have tendency to stop ?
118.649000
why does newton get the credit
113.085000
"a bit of a weird question but I noticed i have no idea who the third guy is in the painting and I know three important  guys helped with physics, a greek philosopher, Newton and Galileo but how come I've never heard anyone mention  the third man? Did he have the same theory as the three I have learned about? Or is he that unimportant to not be  added in my physics lessons in class?"
109.745000
"At 1:49, when he mentions their names, he says Galileo, Newton, and Descartes. One thing that I am curious about is  why is he known as Galileo, not by his last name, Galilei like the other two?"
94.188000
"How did Newton prove his first law of motion? I understand that things move with a constant velocity in space but at  the time, there was no technology available to do experiments in space. Which experiment did he use to prove this  law at the time?"
118.649000
if galaleu got it first then i dont really see why newton got the credit, so why did he and not galaleu
94.188000
"Ok..so can anyone name a medium where this law will truly prove right...now it obviously can't be ground because ground  offers friction when an object is moving...in other words is there any instance which proves this law right"
101.899000
At 1:42, why is it that we name it after Newton if Descartes and Galileo did as much work?
113.085000
"Why doesn't Renae get as much ""popularity"" i guess? I've never heard of him, unlike Galileo and Newton. Is it because  this is the only thing he has helped discover, or has he done more?"
94.188000
i want some examples of newtons first law of motion with explanation
143.097000
"so an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by anouther force? is that correct or  am i totally wrong and what is this a bout net force?"
161.706000
"At 2:46, Sal said that objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity unless acted on by an unbalanced net force.  Does that force have to be acted on from an external source or not?"
161.706000
"Newton's first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest... unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.  But, is there really such a thing as an object at rest? If looked at from our everyday perspective, such as a  person sitting in a chair, we may think the answer would be yes. But, the person in that chair is also sitting  within an Earth that is spinning at nearly 1000 miles per hour, at the equator, while at the same time orbiting around the Sun at 18.5 miles per second. So, can thatobject, in this case a person sitting in a chair, still be  considered to be at rest? And what about the Sun rotating around the center of the Galaxy or our Universe  expanding, thereby moving one galaxy further away from another? I understand that ""rest"" may depend on  your perspective, but can anything truly be considered to be at rest when everything seems to be moving?"
143.097000
I didn't understand what did Sal say at "Objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity?"
161.706000
If the force is balanced doesn't that mean velocity=0?
161.706000
"So does ""balanced"" mean you have reached the equilibrium of counteracting the force of friction. (Therefore when you are able to move the TV set the  2 forces [the force of you pushing it and friction] are in equilibrium?) Is that what Sal was saying by them being balanced? Please Help.   Thank you so much!!"
161.706000
At 2:56 I thought that it was an equal or greater force that would oppose the object moving which one is it thanx
161.706000
at 2:45,how the obejects have tendency to maintain velocity?why there is unbalanced force
143.097000
"At 3:00, Sal said that objects have a tendency to maintain velocity unless acted on by unbalanced force. Why does it  have to be an unbalanced force? Why not a balanced force?"
193.093000
How can you change the volacity
268.486000
Is it possible to eliminate friction?
258.719000
I don't quite understand how the friction can slow an object after the force has propelled the object forward.
258.719000
The thing that I do not understand that said in the video is how can it move forever
266.559000
"at 4:28 sal siad that if we make the surface smoother and smoother the we can make the object go forever and  ever, but can we make the surface that much smooth ?"
314.541000
"If the forces are balanced and friction is equal to the force that you're putting on an object, how come to object even  moves? To my reasoning, you would need to overcome the friction for the object to start moving. I really don't get this."
241.134000
At 4:00 Sal tells us that friction is acting in the opposite direction, but air resistance is doing the same, right?
268.486000
how would you eliminate the friction? but can you even do that?
268.486000
isnt it possible to create a surface that has absolutly 0 friction?
268.486000
"how would we be able to mantain zero friction,? because friction is every where. what?"
247.135000
how do you draw free body diagrams? i dont understand at all!!
273.352000
"So everything would keep moving if the thing that it is resting on was perfectly smooth like if you were to put something  on ice and shoved it it goes for a long time dose that relate to the law at all?"
273.352000
"For friction to go on forever, does the surface of the object have to be smooth as well or just the  surface it is traveling needs to?"
268.486000
Would it be possible to not have friction and have something slide to no end?
315.791000
"I don't understand how balancing the force of pushing a block with the friction causes the block to move. If I push a  block and a friend pushing just as hard on the block but from the other direction, it wouldn't be moving now would it?"
315.791000
at6:50,if the surface is frictionless the object maintains velocity,but what about atmospheric friction
306.410000
"My science teacher said that friction can go with an object but that really didn't make any sense to me or her explanation. E.g if i push a  box the friction goes with the box in the boxes direction not against it. Anyone care to explain what is going on cause i am confused?"
315.791000
"I had this in my mind since a while now. At 5:11, Sal says that to move a TV across the carpet we need to apply a force equal to the  force of friction in the opposite direction. But in that case shouldn't the TV stop moving because the forces are equal and opposite. "
315.791000
"How does applying a force equal to the counter acting forces move an object? I mean the forces are balanced right?  So what's making the object move at a constant velocity? Shouldn't the push force be greater than the other opposite  forces in order to cause movement? I'm just really confused. Can someone please clarify it for me?"
315.791000
"At 5:13, he says that to maintain a constant velocity, the forces need to balanced. If they're balanced, wouldn't the object be still because there is no net force?"
314.541000
"At 5:00 Sal said to move an object with constant velocity you have to balance the applied force and the force of friction.  I know the velocity will be zero but Wouldn't the force applied have to overcome the force of friction to get any  movement at all?"
314.541000
how do you label a magnitude of force? how do you calculate the magnitude and direction of a resulting force?
314.541000
"At 5:00, Sal says how if you apply a force with a constant velocity, you are essentially just balancing it, does that mean  there is no acceleration? And also after that he mentions how if you want to accelerate the block you will have to apply  more force, so does that mean in this case there is constant acceleration?"
315.791000
"At the end of the video Sal is talking about how, if you want to move your TV set at a constant velocity,  you have to exactly counteract the force of friction. But since the TV set would be at rest when you begin  pushing, and you only just counteract friction, wouldn't this mean that there is no net force applied to your  TV set, and it would stay at rest? Shouldn't your push generate a larger force than the force of friction just  to get the TV set moving?"
30.334000
"0:31 he said we have never seen that just keeps moving on and on without applying force with it but a ballon goes  up to the sky and we don't do anything to it"
