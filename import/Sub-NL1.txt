1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,909
Human beings have always observed that is you have

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,862
an object that is moving,

3
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:08,434
so this is a moving object,

4
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:10,829
traveling to the right here,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,800
that it seems to stop on it's own.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,211
That if you do nothing to this moving object,

7
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:19,500
on it's own, this object is going to come to a stop.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,784
It is going to come to rest.

9
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:24,537
And on the other side of things,

10
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:26,212
if you want to keep an object moving,

11
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:28,477
you have to keep applying a force to it.

12
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:30,334
We've never in our everyday experience

13
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,628
seen an object that just keeps moving

14
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:34,841
on and on forever without anyone acting on it.

15
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:37,630
It seems like something will always stop.

16
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,756
And this is why, for most of human history,

17
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:42,245
probably pre-history, but we definitely know the ancient Greeks

18
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:45,643
all the way until the early 1600s,

19
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:49,641
so for at least 2000 years,

20
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:54,553
the assumption was "objects have a natural tendency to stop."

21
00:00:54,553 --> 00:01:02,248
Objects ... have ... tendency ... to come to rest or to stop.

22
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:07,300
And if you want to keep them moving,

23
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:17,326
you have to apply some type of a net force to it.

24
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,784
And once again, this is completly consistent with

25
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:23,230
everyday human experience,

26
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,925
this is what we've all experienced our entire lives.

27
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:30,364
But then these gentlemen show up in the 1600s,

28
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:34,188
and you might be surprised to see three gentlemen here,

29
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:36,663
because this is about Newton's first law of motion.

30
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,774
And, indead, one of these gentlemen is

31
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,434
Sir Isaac Newton.

32
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,899
That's Newton right over there [middle].

33
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,514
But these other too guys get at least as much credit for it

34
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:46,746
because they actually described really what

35
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,113
Newton's first Law describes,

36
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:49,745
and they did it before Newton.

37
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:51,436
This is Galileo.

38
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,320
And this is Rene Descarts.

39
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:58,649
And they describe it in different ways,

40
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,548
and Newton frankly get's the credit for it

41
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:02,766
because he really encapsulates into a broader framework

42
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:05,160
with his other Laws, and the Laws of Gravitation,

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,968
which was really the basics of classical mechanics,

44
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:11,114
and seem to describe, at least until the 20th Century,

45
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:14,413
most of how reality actually worked.

46
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:17,381
And their big insight, and it was very unintuitive at the time,

47
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:19,965
{so now we come to the 1600s}

48
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,215
Is that these three gentlemen said,

49
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:23,970
maybe it works the other way.

50
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:36,828
Maybe objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity, their speed and their direction.

51
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:41,706
And if their speed is zero, they'll maintain that restfulness.

52
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:46,930
Unless they're acted upon by an unbalanced force.

53
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,582
So the completly opposite way of thinking.

54
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:03,831
For over 2000 years, objects tend to stop on their own,

55
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:05,914
if you want to keep the movement, apply a force.

56
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:07,332
These guys say,

57
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:10,870
Objects hava tendency to maintain their motion forever

58
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,930
and the only way that your going to stop them is

59
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,114
if you act on it, or accelerate them, or change their velocity,

60
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:17,949
so either their speed or direction some way,

61
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,617
is to act on them with an unbalanced force.

62
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:22,560
But you might be saying,

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,510
Hey, come on Sal, what's going on?

64
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,206
You just went through this,

65
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,531
you said for most of most of human history,

66
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:28,164
including my own personal history,

67
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:29,826
this is what I observed [top right].

68
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:32,863
How can these guys say that this thing has a tendency to

69
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,333
go on forever?

70
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,635
This seems to break down.

71
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:37,783
And their big insight was,

72
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:40,498
well, maybe these things don't have, by themselves,

73
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:42,968
a tendency to stop, but because of interactions

74
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,516
with their environment, forces are being generated

75
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,864
that are acting against their motion.

76
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:50,600
So when you think you're leaving this thing alone,

77
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,233
there is actualy a net force that is trying to stop it.

78
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,750
And in this particular example over here,

79
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,134
the net force is the force of friction.

80
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:04,386
It's the interaction between the block and the ground.

81
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:07,135
So, when you think you're leaving this thing alone,

82
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:10,851
you actually have a net force going against it's motion,

83
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,100
which is the force of friction.

84
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,358
And these guys realize that,

85
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:15,251
because they said,

86
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,387
look, if it was an innate property of the block,

87
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,719
regardless of the environment,

88
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:20,683
it should kind of always come to a stop

89
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,437
in maybe a similar way.

90
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:25,251
But they saw, if you made this surface a little bit smoother

91
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,486
this thing would travel further and further.

92
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:31,600
Maybe if you eliminated this friction,

93
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,352
if you made this surface completely friction-less,

94
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:36,311
completely smooth, this thing indead would travel forever.

95
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:38,902
And they didn't have the luxury of launching satilites,

96
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,787
and doing things in deep space,

97
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:44,769
so it was a very, very unintuitive thought experiment.

98
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,584
And you might say, what about this other thing,

99
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,110
what happens when I am applying the force?

100
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,492
Becuase in my everyday life,

101
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:52,800
If I want to drag my TV set across the room

102
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,791
I apply a force to it.

103
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,442
And what these guys would tell you

104
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:56,298
is all you were doing,

105
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,644
if you were keeping the velocity of that TV constant,

106
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:03,425
all you were doing was counteracting this net negative force.

107
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:06,410
So if this was a TV dragging across your carpet,

108
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,575
this is the force of friction acting against the motion

109
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,811
of the object,

110
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,541
and so you are essentially just balancing it when you push it.

111
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,791
If you balance it perfectly,

112
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,791
you will be able to maintain it's velocity.

113
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,175
If you want to accelerate it,

114
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:24,599
you will have to apply even more force in the direction you are actually moving it.

115
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:25,199
Many thanks to Sal! :)
