-1
is the net force produced by interaction of objects in the directions opposite to motion
-1
"No. Gravity is a force that does not need interaction between objects because it is always present.  However, on the moon where the gravitational pull is so weak, you can't really feel the gravity pulling."

It's gravity another force thats acts against another object when forced is applied to an object at rest, like friction.
-1
what about matter,all create friction,but a solid starts motion and stops motion.
-1
"from 00:29, we can only observe this kind of movement in space, where the absence of friction enables an object to  move at a constant rate"
-1
0:41 they made mention of greeks is that where the founding of force started
-1
"when the objects change their motion[rest/moving] due to unbalanced forces right the what happens  when it is acted by balanced forces for moving/rest as per newtons law of motion"

52
What does velocity technically mean?
50
what is velocity?
50
"Newton,Galileo,Descartes didn't have any modern techniques to prove First law of motion so how did they proved this  statement-""Objects have tendency to maintain velocity unless acted on by unbalanced force"""

what is acceleration , speed and velocity ?
59
What is velocity?
50
At around 2:50, what is an example of a balanced force?
52
What does velocity mean?
50
"Why does Sal use the term ""unbalanced force""? The word ""unbalanced"" is particularly confusing since I learned Newton's law as follows: objects have the tendency to remain in motion until acted on by an ""outside"" force. "
52
What is the meaning of 'unbalanced force' ?
52
What is velocity?
50
What does Sal mean by an unbalanced force?
52
what is velocity
50
sir, can you tell me about balanced and unbalanced force
52
A small question. What do you mean by unbalanced forces?
52
what is velocity?
50
throughout the video you used the word velocity what is velocity?
50
what is velocity?
50
what is acceleration , speed and velocity ?
59
"From 2:56 and 3:01 Sal says 2000 years+ people believe that Objects have tendency to stop on their own, if you want to keep it moving apply force. On 3:01 Objects have tendency to maintain velocity unless acted on by an unbalanced force. So my question is who made these two rues? Was it Newton or someone else?"
56
"At 4:00 - 4:10, Sal mentioned a net force... would that be the same thing a gravity?  Or would gravity full under one of the net forces?"

"there are instuments to measure any thing, how can we measure a foce i.e we say that a force of  78N is acting on a body,how we measured it"

"y the acceleration is the same 9.8?  proven? F=am F=Gmamb/r*? cuz idk"
-1
why inertia dependent on mass of the object.??
-1
Why does the earth rotates on its axis?
-1
"When I first studied friction I faced f = μ N where f is force of friction, μ is coefficient of friction for the surface considered and N is the normal force for the body on surface. Now f is a force so it must be a vector which means it has a direction. N is normal force so it has direction too. But both f and N are  mutually perpendicular to each other! And μ is a constant, so how can we write f and N in one equation? They do not have the same direction!  I think this is not clear to me because I have never read about the origin of this equation. From where do we get it?"
-1
does this mean all things are always moving but they are staying motionless because of a unbalanced force?
-1
"so does it mean that if the object is at constant velocity or stationary;  the upward and downward forces are equal to the forward and backward forces"
-1
"I dont understand why an object going at constant velocity has zero net force. If I through a ball into space,  with Force F, and no other forces act on it, will the ball keep accelerating to the speed of light?"
-1
Is it possible to create a frictionless surface? If so, how?
-1
"It was said that if we were pushing with exactly enough force to counter-act the forces holding the box in place that it  would move with constant velocity, however isn't the fact that the box is moving in the pushed/pulled direction mean  that there is a net force in that direction? If the forces were perfectly balanced, why does the object not stay still?"
-1
"So, are the forces balanced even when the object has velocity, or just when it is sitting still? Is unbalanced force  a change in velocity (acceleration)?"
-1
"What would the particular unbalanced force be? How do you completely take friction out of a situation? Would eliminating  friction have a positive or negative impact on the world? If eliminating friction is positive why don't we take friction out  of the world?"
-1
How is a non- zero net force required to cause an acceleration?
-1
"So by the 1600's Galileo,Descartes and Newton had completely radicalised the long held views that Objects stopped  themselves, and they proved it was an unbalanced force stopped them?"
-1
Why is said that Newton's Laws cannot be proved?
-1
"I read that objects at constant velocity have 0 net force, but then how are they even moving. Isn't a force needed to make an obj move? Doesn't the fact  that an obj at constant velocity move mean that there must be a force acting on it to make it move? My second question is if the net force is 0 then that means all the forces canceled out so how will an obj still have a constant veloctiy instead of just being at rest?"
-1
"In the second 22 (too specific) you said that there is always a force causing motion to a moving object, so what force in  keeping the Earth rotating around the Sun? Is it gravity? And what would happen if this force just disappeared? Would  the Earth just come to a stop?"
-1
"my question is actually related to Galileo's inclined plane experiment , how does the rolling marble attain a velocity  and tries to reach out to the same height when it starts climbing the right side plane?"
-1
Then who really made the laws of gravity and motion? Who actually gets the credit and who actually made them?
-1
"Hasn't animals from prehistory instinctively know that things eventually stop because  sometimes they chase things down to death?"
-1
"so basically,object maintains its state of rest or motion under the influence of balanced force and to change this state of  rest or motion we need to apply an unbalanced force,right?"
-1
why the object will stop?
-1
At 1:23, Why did they believe objects had a natural tendency to stop?
20
AT 1:13 how can you apply a net force on an object
23
how do net forces work? I don't really understand.
23
at 58,how is it that objects come to a stop because of gravity? I just don't get it!
20
why does objects have tendency to stop ?
20
why does newton get the credit
40
"a bit of a weird question but I noticed i have no idea who the third guy is in the painting and I know three important  guys helped with physics, a greek philosopher, Newton and Galileo but how come I've never heard anyone mention  the third man? Did he have the same theory as the three I have learned about? Or is he that unimportant to not be  added in my physics lessons in class?"
38
"At 1:49, when he mentions their names, he says Galileo, Newton, and Descartes. One thing that I am curious about is  why is he known as Galileo, not by his last name, Galilei like the other two?"
37
"How did Newton prove his first law of motion? I understand that things move with a constant velocity in space but at  the time, there was no technology available to do experiments in space. Which experiment did he use to prove this  law at the time?"
29
if galaleu got it first then i dont really see why newton got the credit, so why did he and not galaleu
40
"Ok..so can anyone name a medium where this law will truly prove right...now it obviously can't be ground because ground  offers friction when an object is moving...in other words is there any instance which proves this law right"
29
At 1:42, why is it that we name it after Newton if Descartes and Galileo did as much work?
33
"Why doesn't Renae get as much ""popularity"" i guess? I've never heard of him, unlike Galileo and Newton. Is it because  this is the only thing he has helped discover, or has he done more?"
38
i want some examples of newtons first law of motion with explanation
29
"so an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by anouther force? is that correct or  am i totally wrong and what is this a bout net force?"
50
"At 2:46, Sal said that objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity unless acted on by an unbalanced net force.  Does that force have to be acted on from an external source or not?"
52
"Newton's first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest... unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.  But, is there really such a thing as an object at rest? If looked at from our everyday perspective, such as a  person sitting in a chair, we may think the answer would be yes. But, the person in that chair is also sitting  within an Earth that is spinning at nearly 1000 miles per hour, at the equator, while at the same time orbiting around the Sun at 18.5 miles per second. So, can thatobject, in this case a person sitting in a chair, still be  considered to be at rest? And what about the Sun rotating around the center of the Galaxy or our Universe  expanding, thereby moving one galaxy further away from another? I understand that ""rest"" may depend on  your perspective, but can anything truly be considered to be at rest when everything seems to be moving?"
52
I didn't understand what did Sal say at "Objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity?"
50
If the force is balanced doesn't that mean velocity=0?
52
"So does ""balanced"" mean you have reached the equilibrium of counteracting the force of friction. (Therefore when you are able to move the TV set the  2 forces [the force of you pushing it and friction] are in equilibrium?) Is that what Sal was saying by them being balanced? Please Help.   Thank you so much!!"
52
At 2:56 I thought that it was an equal or greater force that would oppose the object moving which one is it thanx
52
at 2:45,how the obejects have tendency to maintain velocity?why there is unbalanced force
52
"At 3:00, Sal said that objects have a tendency to maintain velocity unless acted on by unbalanced force. Why does it  have to be an unbalanced force? Why not a balanced force?"
50
How can you change the volacity
59
Is it possible to eliminate friction?
92
I don't quite understand how the friction can slow an object after the force has propelled the object forward.
88
The thing that I do not understand that said in the video is how can it move forever
88
listening to that last piont on friction, friction effects an item when it is not moving? am i right?
-1
Is gravity along with friction what makes things stop?
-1
"at 4:28 sal siad that if we make the surface smoother and smoother the we can make the object go forever and  ever, but can we make the surface that much smooth ?"
91
"If the forces are balanced and friction is equal to the force that you're putting on an object, how come to object even  moves? To my reasoning, you would need to overcome the friction for the object to start moving. I really don't get this."
111
At 4:00 Sal tells us that friction is acting in the opposite direction, but air resistance is doing the same, right?
80
how would you eliminate the friction? but can you even do that?
92
isnt it possible to create a surface that has absolutly 0 friction?
92
"how would we be able to mantain zero friction,? because friction is every where. what?"
92
how do you draw free body diagrams? i dont understand at all!!
82
"So everything would keep moving if the thing that it is resting on was perfectly smooth like if you were to put something  on ice and shoved it it goes for a long time dose that relate to the law at all?"
94
"For friction to go on forever, does the surface of the object have to be smooth as well or just the  surface it is traveling needs to?"
94
Would it be possible to not have friction and have something slide to no end?
92
"I don't understand how balancing the force of pushing a block with the friction causes the block to move. If I push a  block and a friend pushing just as hard on the block but from the other direction, it wouldn't be moving now would it?"
112
at6:50,if the surface is frictionless the object maintains velocity,but what about atmospheric friction
112
"My science teacher said that friction can go with an object but that really didn't make any sense to me or her explanation. E.g if i push a  box the friction goes with the box in the boxes direction not against it. Anyone care to explain what is going on cause i am confused?"
108
"I had this in my mind since a while now. At 5:11, Sal says that to move a TV across the carpet we need to apply a force equal to the  force of friction in the opposite direction. But in that case shouldn't the TV stop moving because the forces are equal and opposite. "
112
"How does applying a force equal to the counter acting forces move an object? I mean the forces are balanced right?  So what's making the object move at a constant velocity? Shouldn't the push force be greater than the other opposite  forces in order to cause movement? I'm just really confused. Can someone please clarify it for me?"
112
"At 5:13, he says that to maintain a constant velocity, the forces need to balanced. If they're balanced, wouldn't the object be still because there is no net force?"
112
"At 5:00 Sal said to move an object with constant velocity you have to balance the applied force and the force of friction.  I know the velocity will be zero but Wouldn't the force applied have to overcome the force of friction to get any  movement at all?"
111
how do you label a magnitude of force? how do you calculate the magnitude and direction of a resulting force?
111
"At 5:00, Sal says how if you apply a force with a constant velocity, you are essentially just balancing it, does that mean  there is no acceleration? And also after that he mentions how if you want to accelerate the block you will have to apply  more force, so does that mean in this case there is constant acceleration?"
111
"At the end of the video Sal is talking about how, if you want to move your TV set at a constant velocity,  you have to exactly counteract the force of friction. But since the TV set would be at rest when you begin  pushing, and you only just counteract friction, wouldn't this mean that there is no net force applied to your  TV set, and it would stay at rest? Shouldn't your push generate a larger force than the force of friction just  to get the TV set moving?"
112

-1
"Is it possible for if you had an object and threw it, would it continuously move until  it moves into the gravitational field of some star or something?"

So, technically, in space objects can maintain a constant velocity because there is no unbalanced force?
-1
"suppose if a body is at rest at ground , gravity is holding it downwards to its surface.  then if there was a zero gravity then how would it continue being at rest?"

"I have a question not about this content and my question is If you are travelling in the car at the speed of  60 Km/h and there is a mosquito inside the car, why does the mosquito do not hit the rear glass and how  does it still fly's inside the car??"
-1
if i spin a spinning top in outer space,will it keep spinning unless someone touches it?
-1
"Is friction caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth? Assuming that it is, then can we really say there is friction because gravitational pull only gets weaker by distance but it never disappear?"

"Does earth has inertia when it is rotating and revolving?If somehow gravity would disappear even there it would keep  the same state??"
-1
"What abut the Earth and planets? they rotate on an axis and humans don't push it. There is no force that we cause  and there is no wind in space. So how is the Earth moving? Or do we do something that causes in to move?"
-1
"Wait , if the net force if pushing one way then why does the object stop...Shouldn't it just start moving the the direction  the net force is pushing it?"

"I think LAW OF INERTIA is wrong ? An object cannot change its state of rest or motion unless and until compelled to a force... Let me travel in an accelerating spaceship and an object be resting in the galaxy in reference to me the body is accelerating but no force is applied to it...  this means that force is not require for a body to accelerate ... this contradicts with the law of inertia .. Where am I going wrong ?"
-1
If there was no friction then wouldn't the air particles stop the thing?
-1
"So does the Earth have friction acted upon it as it travels through space, or is there no friction in space and therefore  it can travel in its orbit, assuming the Sun's gravity, forever? Is momentum involved, or something?"

is gravity another force that acts upon an object when force is applied to an object at rest, like friction?
-1
So friction stops moving objects unless acted on by an outside force
-1
"Can anyone describe what the universe would be like if Newton's 1st Law was invalid? Perhaps,  both qualitatively and quantitatively?"

"I have a question: May seem stupid but lets see a satellite in the orbit. It is orbiting the earth under the influence of  gravity but see it is moving around the earth and to keep to moving energy is need or else we would lose it but then  isn't or should be some sort of limit like uh gravitational energy reverse or something like that?

"I have 2 questions about this video :  An object of mass ""m"" is travelling at a constant velocity ""v"". It has *no* forces acting on it.  1) What is the force required to stop it? 2) What is the work done while stopping it?  These are the somewhat fundamental questions that arose in my mind after watching the video. In the second part, the work done should be equal to the energy of the object. The energy in this case will be kinetic energy only. So is the work done equal  to (1/2)mv^2? I'm a little"

-1
"say you are on a train moving 100 mph and the train was moving 100 mph the opposite direction. What would happen if the train stopped? Would  you momentarily stop? Would you shoot forward even faster? or would you just continue going forward 100 mph? (you are inside the train moving in the opposite direction at EXACTLY the same speed) (I know from the outside it would appear as if you weren't moving, but what happens when  you stop?)"

-1
"If nothing existed that would not stop an object the object would always go on forever but until those object stopping  things would stop the object of course, but will the object be hot? I don't know because if nothing that would stop an  object that does that mean friction still existed, even if friction was NOT to stop an object? I think friction is one thing that would stop an object."

The earth moves without applying any force how?
-1
Is there any quantity in which inertia can be represented ?
-1

"I understand why a cork moves to the edges of a cup filled with water, but after thinking about it, I sort of wondered what would happen if a cork was placed in water without disturbing the surface? I know it is  impossible to place a cork on water without disturbing the surface. But if we could, would it move to the  center, stay where it was put, or move to the edge of the cup? It would be nice if you would explain, put a  link, or tell me which video Sal has posted could help me."

"FYI, Newtonian Physics, pragmatically, works but is false. Contemporary physics tends to use general relativity, because  Einstein proved Newton false, and yet Einsteinian physics is better but still isn't entirely accurate either. What should we  have in mind when using physics in light of these criticisms?"
