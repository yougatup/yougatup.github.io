around the Sun at 18.5 miles per second. So, can thatobject, in this case a person sitting in a chair, still be 
considered to be at rest? And what about the Sun rotating around the center of the Galaxy or our Universe

wondered what would happen if a cork was placed in water without disturbing the surface? I know it is 
impossible to place a cork on water without disturbing the surface. But if we could, would it move to the 
center, stay where it was put, or move to the edge of the cup? It would be nice if you would explain, put a 
link, or tell me which video Sal has posted could help me."									#	0	1	3	-1

We know that the Earth rotates on its axis and around the Sun. How does the Earth do that and from where does the Earth get the force
